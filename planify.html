                  <h5>background</h5>
                  <p>
                      When I first started university, two pieces of advice that I heard the most were: 
                      1) What worked for you in high school might not work for you in university, and 2)
                      Keep an agenda! 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In high school, I’d used a paper agenda, but as university life kicked in and schoolwork, events and interviews started piling up, I quickly realized that I needed a more flexible, smarter agenda/planner. 
                  </p>
    
                  <p>
                    In the efforts to find a solution to my ever-growing pain of not being able to plan out my life, based on recommendations from friends and blogs, I tried out several different digital and analog systems including: bullet journaling, Google calendar, iCal, MyHomework, MyStudyLife and Trello, to name a few.
                  </p>
    
                  <p>
                    While some of these solutions worked, I found myself using a combination of two (or more) different apps/systems to achieve the workflow that I desired. (Currently, I’m using a combination of Trello, Google calendar and iCal)
                  </p>
    
                  <p>
                    This inspired me to design an app that would be flexible and smart enough so I wouldn’t have to keep switching between two or more apps.
                  </p>

                  <h5>user research</h5>
                  <p>Since the idea for Planify came directly from personal need, I wanted to see if this was a problem for other students as well. 

                      With the help of some help, I surveyed over 330 students and asked them about their planner/agenda system, what they liked and disliked.
                  </p>

                  <p>Here are some of the results from the survey:
                  </p>

                  <img style="width: 70%" src="projects/planify/infographic.png">

                  <h5>comparative analysis</h5>
                  <p>Earlier I mentioned that I had tried out some methods that my friends swore by. Since I was designing my own, I wanted to see what made each of them so appealing to my friends. In particular, I studied how other applications organized, stored and displayed their content, the general workflow, and what worked and didn’t work. I chose to study Google Calendar (calendar-based), Trello (todo-list/project management based) and MyHomework (student focused).
                  </p>

                  <p>Here were some of the takeaways:</p>
                  <img src="projects/planify/comparativeanalysis.png">

                  <h5>goals</h5>
                  <p>After having done my research, I established some goals that I hoped to establish with my design:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Flexible and customizable</li>
                    <li>Easy organization</li>
                    <li>Fast data entry</li>
                    <li>Add more features not normally found in planning apps:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Keep track of things without set due dates (provide just enough disassociation)</li>
                        <li>Project manage and break down projects into doable chunks</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>    
              </div>

              <div id="part2" class="writeup-part">
                <h4>the design process</h4>
                <h5>finding the flow</h5>
                <p>I sketched out a rough flowchart which became a basis for the pen and paper wireframes:</p>
                <img style="width: 80%;" src="projects/planify/sketch.png">

                <p>I also planned out the information architecture and decided what could go on each page</p>
                <img src="projects/planify/ia.png">

                <h5>Pen and paper wireframes</h5>
                <p>I wanted to make this product as gesture-friendly as possible to give users a sense of movability. This was especially important to me because as the name suggests, a planner is used to <em>plan</em>, not set things in stone. To achieve this, from the earliest stages, I decided to go with a card-based approach, to encourage users to move things around like they would be able to with post-its.</p>

                <h5>Branding the app</h5>
                <p>I chose blue as the primary colour since psychologically, it’s an “intellectual” colour associated with productivity. I went with San Francisco for the main display font to give it a familiar look (since I was designing for iPhone because it’s the phone I had which made testing easier) </p>

                <!-- <h5>goals – accomplished</h5>
                <p>Here’s how I accomplished the goals that I set for myself earlier:</p>
                <img src="assets/image.png"> -->
              </div>

              <div id="part3" class="writeup-part">
                <h4>the progression</h4>
                <h5>testing</h5>
                <p>I tested my designs to validate my assumptions and decisions. I made interactive prototypes on Figma and conducted a series of user interviews. I recorded what worked and didn’t work, and what people liked and didn’t like.</p>
                <p>One challenge that people had was discovering how to set a task without a fixed due date. This was because to do so, they would have had to tap the due date settings before choosing the time frame they wanted. I fixed this by placing this option outside the “choose date” modal.</p>
                <img src="projects/planify/modifiedflow.png">
                <p>I also A/B tested a couple of designs.</p>
              </div> 

              <div id="part4" class="writeup-part">
                <h4>reflection</h4>
                <h5>What i learned</h5>
                <p>
                  This was my first case study ever, and so I learned a lot of things along the way.
                  I learned how to ask meaningful questions during user testing, and do comparative analysis.
                </p>

                <h5>Next steps!</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>I want to add more features! One that I’ve already gotten started on is a Kanban board integration (like on Jira) where you can organize by To-do, doing and done.</li>
                  <li>I want to code this! I’ll most likely start with web since that’s what I’m most familiar with, then use NativeScript or Flutter to make this into a native application.</li>
                </ul>
